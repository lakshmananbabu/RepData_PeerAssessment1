This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Loading and preprocessing the data
activity <- read.csv("F:/Text Analytics Image/activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", 
    "numeric"))
head(activity)
names(activity)
library(lattice)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

##Let us use two approaches

##First is using aggregate function

StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)

#The Histogram is

hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")

# And the mean and median is
mean(StepsTotal$steps)

median(StepsTotal$steps)

#The second approach is to make a data frame first with the values that I need I create a data frame with the days and the total of steps by day

steps <- rep(NA, 61)
day <- rep("NA", 61)
stepsday <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = T)
length(stepsday)

for (i in 1:61) {
    steps[i] <- stepsday[[i]]
    day[i] <- names(stepsday)[i]
}

# then the data frame is

df <- data.frame(day, steps)
head(df)

hist(df$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "green")

## This histogram is a bit differnt because,we have no data for the steps for some days.

# Time Series Plot
time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", 
    ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Average number of steps taken", 
    col = "red")

# Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

max_interval <- which.max(time_series)
names(max_interval)
#Imputing missing values
###Total number of rows with NAs
activity_NA <- sum(is.na(activity))
activity_NA
###Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval,etc

###Fist Na replaced by mean in 5 min interval
StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean)
fillNA <- numeric()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    obs <- activity[i, ]
    if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
        steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps
    } else {
        steps <- obs$steps
    }
    fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps)
}
###Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
new_activity <- activity
new_activity$steps <- fillNA
###Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
StepsTotal2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
###The Histogram is
hist(StepsTotal2$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
###And the mean and median is
mean(StepsTotal2$steps)
median(StepsTotal2$steps)
###After replacing the mean is the same but the median is a little bit different
#Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
###For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

###Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels weekdayand weekend indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
day <- weekdays(activity$date)
daylevel <- vector()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    if (day[i] == "Saturday") {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
    } else if (day[i] == "Sunday") {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
    } else {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekday"
    }
}
activity$daylevel <- daylevel
activity$daylevel <- factor(activity$daylevel)

stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daylevel, data = activity, mean)
names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "daylevel", "steps")
###Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was creating using simulated data:
xyplot(steps ~ interval | daylevel, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
